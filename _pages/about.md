I am a Machine Learning Scientist and Head of Protein Design at <a href="https://profluent.bio">Profluent Bio</a>. At Profluent, I am focused on developing and applying langauge models for functional protein design, particularly in the area of genome editing. Generally, I am interested in learning from nature to design proteins with applications in medicine and biotechnology, which language models seem particularly good at.

My recent work includes contributions to the design of <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.22.590591v1">OpenCRISPR-1</a>, a highly functional genome editor that we released for free and ethical use, and the development of <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.03.606485v1">proseLM</a>, a model for protein sequence generation conditioned on atomistic structural and functional context.

During my PhD in <a href="https://pmb.jhu.edu/">molecular biophysics</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, I worked in the lab of <a href="https://graylab.jhu.edu/">Jeffrey J. Gray</a> on deep learning models for antibody structure prediction, representation learning, and sequence generation. Before that, I worked on protein structure prediction and computational modeling of lamprey neurons while I was an undergraduate studying biochemistry and computer science at <a href="https://www.missouri.edu/">Mizzou</a>.
